test-subrepo
============

This change will be committed to the test-main-repo to see what happens with
the subrepo.

The steps for using subrepo seem easy:

1. make changes like normal
2. commit to main repo as much as you like
3. push to main repo as much as you like
4. when you want to commit/push to the subrepo just run: 
   git subrepo push <options>
